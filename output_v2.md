**Xie Xiaoze**: ...be my first time. You know, I got to know about, the stop map, the statute, from reading the book. You know, these thick volumes of, you know, the Dunhuang manuscripts in the British collection, in the French collections, in the Russian collection. This whole set up like, books, which I, you know. Dig into... In the past few years.

**Greg Panciera**: Right. That's awesome.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah. And that's also that's also one of the, you know, that's kind of, one of one of several things that that we're hoping to talk about. But I think to start, we kind of want to talk a little bit more about your, your background in the project and kind of what brought you to the project.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Okay. So, in the past, I have been making works, paintings, installations, video art related to books in libraries. And then, the destruction, planning of books, destruction of libraries, censorship. You know, so, so my work, overall has, always been concerned with, history and time and memory and the vulnerability of, of, historical memory and knowledge. So, so that's sort of the main aspects, that run through my work. The Dunhuang themes that are kicking in, you know, I said. Opportunity in 2016 when I. Was, invited when I was. Asked whether, I want to join this VIP tour group, a small group, to visit Dunhuang, and then also a few other locations. In the west northwest of China. And that was organized by, the Dunhuang Foundation, Mimi Gates and Lucy Sun, who I'm very grateful to. They. So I decided. To join and so, so in 20. 16. I went on this tour, with the group, and, that was my first time to be in Dunhuang. Although I had, you know, seen pictures of murals. And in my, in the past, my before that, I've seen, like, copies of Dunhuang murals by my teacher as early as in the late 1980s when I went to undergraduate school. So however, that, that was my first. Experience and at that time. We were discussing the establishing a, artist in residency program, at the Mogao Grottoes. And so, they, somehow so the next year, they somehow feel like I would be, would be good to have me there, you know, be maybe productive given the concerns in my work. My familiarity with the language and the culture. So I was invited as the first. Artist in. Residency in their program. I was very honored. And, of course, there was I had a feeling of this kind of, pressure because the, the status of Dunhuang, is iconic, right? It is has so much importance. And this so much had been done before. People were like Chang Dai-chien, Chang Shushong, Duan Wenjie, so many people. So, so I feel like I said, do something different, you know? So I attempted to do something new. So, anyway, this is quite a bit of research. Before I went in the summer of 2017. And so I've been reading I was reading a lot. And, I found my thinking always, went back to the library cave. You know, it was, a fascinating, so troubled history and, you know, this vast, content, encyclopedic, content of the cultural relics it was stored. So, anyway, when I, when I kind of. Had an idea, had a more specific, wise, but, sort of a vague direction. I was also feeling like, open to experience that murals and other art forms. So in, in the summer of 2017, I was there for about a month, and, I got a. Very nice studio, which the Dunhuang Academy used to, produce large murals. So it's very it has long wooden walls with, like, magnets with, with, with, steel, or iron places behind the wood and so that I can easily stick large sheets of paper with magnets. On the board. So I studied, the scroll drawing using, like this full length, eight eight foot Chinese ba-chi (八尺). This is a 2.5m long. This full sheet of a paper. I cut it down. To be even more horizontal. And so, section by section, I started to, make this, you know, ink drawings, that combine my notes. You know, quoted images, diagrams, and eventually based on that, based on the history, then I started to come up with ideas. Ideas, for three dimensional sculptures and, installations. But I also made that this, this drawings, by themselves could be, you know, of independent work. So I did that and I finished four sections. There are several. Versions about imagination that seem quite promising. And so that's how I started out. And then I feel like I stumble upon, like, treasure Island, you know, this, jewelry cave. However you want to call it. I feel like I, I barely started, so I applied to the, to Dunhuang Foundation to say. Can I go and one more time, and then they also supported me, in 2018. Let me open the door. For my, for, for for a friend. Thank you. [in Chinese, away from the camera, talking to friends]. Okay, so this, 17 and 18, I was there for a shorter period of time. I continued to expand the. Themes in my. Scroll, to include ancient Chinese, astronomy and astrology and, then I also look into, like, 16. Languages in the West, I mean, in the Western region. And then, incorporated, extent, some extent languages into the idea of the rain of. Of of languages. Rain of the words, you know. In addition to Chinese characters, so then, the, the, astronomy and astrology, were very. Difficult because, you know, it was not a field I had any knowledge at all. So I had to do reading and try to reach out to people who may understand it more. I. Managed to find a. Translator for this long essay, which. Is a thorough study of the, star chart. The scroll was written. By, Susan. Whitfield. And, there is a couple of French, scientist at, and then another, author. So anyway, I found a translator who, who, lives in Shenzhen. And, so she helped me with some, you know, understand the astronomy. Anyway, so that was 2018. The process of the, for me, it is. I work on it on and off on, on and off. So but, it wasn't until 2019 that I was able to. Start experimenting with sculptures. So in, in the 2019 where Shenzhen and found these, resins. Resin factory, and started making some tests. And eventually. And then the work was, disrupted by Covid-19. I wasn't able to go back. I tried to. Communicate with a few people I work with to help. Them carry out, experiments. Based on my ideas and designs. And is this never really work out? They got some good, you know, some good technical solutions. And then then after. Covid, after 20, in this the. Spring of 2023. Then I was able to get back and then I spent many weeks there, and I finally was able to produce a group of, three-dimensional works. It is sometime between between 2019 and 2024. I also made like a large scroll joint, large scroll, paintings. Combining it with, with found objects to, make installations. There were a couple of, large scale installations. They are now one, it was in the Shenzhen solo show. And then the other is in the Shanghai, group exhibition. I have a new one. In the studio, so I should I should do. This. And most recently, I developed, two pieces. One is a 3D projection, titled models of the universe. And it is, 3D projection mapping. Immersive kind of projection on an object. On sorry, a volume just based on the interior space of the library cave. And it looks like something is happening inside a cave with the, all different kind of, Buddhist cosmology, like Sanjie Jiudi （三界九地） and, the, three realms and nine levels, and then different kind of mandalas in one is combined with another transforming. Into another, so becoming this and then, the models would go from figurative to abstract. You know, becoming purely geometrical. And there's this very rational mathematical. Relationships. To suggest the law of the, of the, the universe in the Buddhist worldview. Eh. I was going to okay, settings. I'm going to show you this, scroll the I was I'm still working on. Background. And. Okay. Now, excuse of messiness of my studio. We can look at the. Corner, there's this hanging. Scroll. On the on the wall to my side there. And there is the output of.

**Ellen Larson**: It's a big studio space.

**Xie Xiaoze**: So that more or less see the space of the, the there was a photo of, Pope Leo. Can, I can you can kind of see it. Yeah. It's going to be installed, as, vertical scroll with some, knobs and dials. You know, punctuating this, the painting and, beyond a painting. Okay. I can show you a picture. Later. Excuse me one more second. Hello. So the I also have a video clip about, 3D projection, if you want to see it.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah, that'd be great.

**Xie Xiaoze**: You'd like to see a clip of it? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. I would have to drop. It to my desktop. It's in my phone. Everything's in my phone, Wikipedia. So it's a long, kind of evolving, projects. Combines. Well, I wouldn't call it. Well, some kind of inspired by, archeology and, Is a study of of, you know, various aspects of culture, calligraphy. Art, Buddhism. Is about five minutes. So we we can stop at any point. And I'm going to share my screen right. It takes a minute to load.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah. I think that one of one of the things that we're really interested in is, you know, how you're moving between different mediums. So you started, you know, with the two dimensional drawings, and then you're also incorporating the three dimensional resin, object, you know, the, the reconstruction or the, the small scale model of the library cave. And then also, you know, the the digital video,

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah. So I guess primarily. I've always been a painter, and I had my training in architecture for five years, from Tsinghua. And somewhat, this played a big role in this whole project, because the imagination of the interior space and this, you know, this kind of structure. And I did piece. And inside the empty space, I use my, big brush, you know, the chain. This always in the back of my head to show it. And I was able to use, like, brush draws very light ink. And then I can go darker if I feel more surer. And so those are those drawings are, a combination of, Chinese brush drawings, because there are some traditional Chinese art elements, like landscapes, rocks, water and whatever. This way. Traditional vocabularies in Chinese painting and in this architectural, language. And then of course, there designed there's a conceptual underpinning, so all these things come together and then because I practice calligraphy, I mean, not super intensively. But I did do some when I was younger, and now I, in the past few years, since 2017, I got more and more interested and serious of calligraphy, and I, practice more as I work. I moved square alone, so my my my writing, I think, is getting better. So, so all these things. I think, like, I. Found this project, that allows me to combine somewhat different, aspects of my experience, my knowledge and skills.

**Ellen Larson**: Right.

**Xie Xiaoze**: And they was very exciting. If you could, please empower me to share my screen. And I would.

**Ellen Larson**: Of course.

**Xie Xiaoze**: In a video.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah, it's it's really it is really interesting how, you know, like, even with rain of language, right. The, that, that three D.

**Xie Xiaoze**: And.

**Ellen Larson**: Model. Yeah. But it's still, you know, there's I think that there's still there's definitely a sense of architecture in, in, in your calligraphy as well.

**Xie Xiaoze**: I thought maybe. I should request, I'm good now.

**Ellen Larson**: I think you should be able to share now.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yes, yes. Okay.

**Ellen Larson**: Perfect.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Okay. Did you see it? Okay. Yeah, yeah. Make it the maximum. And I should also have the sound on. Is the sound on. We'll see. Did you hear the sound and see my screen? No.

**Ellen Larson**: I don't think we hear. We can see your screen, but there's no sound that.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Okay.

**Greg Panciera**: When you do the, share screen, I think there's a little checkbox at the bottom of that, that says share sound or just.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was the perfect word.

**Unknown**: If they were asking.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Can you hear hear now?

**Ellen Larson**: Yep. Okay. Great.

**Unknown**: 

**Xie Xiaoze**: So this is the [unintelligible] to Wind and water. Gold and air. Okay, to be clear, I. Now you seem to like abstraction. And what's your magic bullet? The kind of schematic drawing. And it's actually supposed to even be the letters, which is like a door that intersect with the world or something. Okay, for me, it's actually. And then this is this. And the star sky is, based on based on the star chart and the British Library collection.

**Unknown**: 

**Xie Xiaoze**: You know, the idea of 三千大千世界 （a great chiliocosm; tri-sahasra-mahā-sahasra-loka-dhātu）. Right. You. Know that that, mandala. Is actually, Yuan dynasty the tapestry from the MET connection. This one is not from the library cave. And this one. Is. This one is from the French collection. And it. And then audio, I compared and combined different kind of Mandalas, intended to 2D to 3D. Here, then again. Abstraction into geometric forms. And, to try to find the. Relationships is a lot like. Because I did [unintelligible], most. He did these, squares, circles.

**Unknown**:  

**Xie Xiaoze**: Okay. This is a five minute, ten second video.

**Ellen Larson**: That was amazing. It's like an infinity.

**Greg Panciera**: It will be. You'll be showing that, in in a physical space somewhere?

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah. I will be showing it at the Tsinghua University Art Museum starting March the 1st in this piece. An earlier version of this. Piece is now, being shown at the, dunhuang contemporary art. Museum in Shanghai.  Although it's an earlier version, I think this is much better. I have made a lot of color revisions in. But the the physical. Space and the box that they built, you know, this architectural form that they built in Shanghai was really good. They have enough space, and they make this 1 to 1. A library cave model. Well, in Tsinghua, because we are projecting, they were put it into a niche space. And the niche space is low, ceiling is less than three meters. And so we had to shrink it. We had to scale it down a bit. And then in, in the San Francisco show, there is small gallery. So I'm doing that. We reduced the volume of the cave into like one eighth linear width is half of what the library cave is. And this is, you know, it's not because, limit of time. It's not ideal. I still feel like, you know, we have is a prototype. Is is fine, but it's a real, like, unfinished work. It needs to be better. So, but the video itself. I think, is really getting there.

**Greg Panciera**: So what we just saw is just a is just a 2D camera view of this whole of this whole video, but you're saying it would be projected in three dimensions as if you were inside of the space we just saw?

**Xie Xiaoze**: No, it's, it you know, we are going to build a, a house like form, and then the projection will projected on the outside of it is only projected onto the frontal side, which is this more. Vertical kind of surface. And then the, the receding wall, the receding ceiling, like the vaulted ceiling, one side of the vaulted ceiling. And when you look at it from the front, at a certain distance. It will look like that. This three dimensional. Pagodas and. Mountains when you're actually inside. The supposed to be outside. But in fact you don't get into. The space. You just. Watch from, outside. And so there is. Yeah.

**Ellen Larson**: Interesting. And so that's a little bit different from the presentation that you created in Shenzhen. Is that right?

**Xie Xiaoze**: That's correct. You, you you.  Completely right, the Shenzhen install, the Shenzhen show. It does not include a 3D projection. But it includes a tent. A amplified version of the library cave. Because of the space, it's much bigger. And and it becomes. A, VR experience space. So people line up to wear the headset. Right? And then they, they walk inside this, this tent like, structure, with, like, that is covered with thick. Handmade. Paper. And then I, you know, I collaborated with a group of local, calligraphers to write these, floating characters, big and small, lighter ink and and darker ink to sort of, make an even larger version of the rain of words, idea. However, these are not it. Wasn't. Really meant to be. It was it's functional because you need those graphics in for graphic information to, for, for the, for the camera to tell and to work with this VR technology. But. You can just. Print some kind of, pattern to do it. Or, I think too you look it kind of too graphic. So I decided to make it, turned it into a installation by itself. So this is what happened. And so at the same time, Shanghai is showing the earlier version of this 3D projection, and once I have this file, you know, we can show it anywhere. If you can build, build a model.  Adjusted in scale. So, when we had this curatorial meeting prepared, preparation meeting, with the Tsinghua museum staff and the curator, Wu Hung Laoshi, we, we discuss it in, actually, Wu Hung was very open to this new stuff he wanted to do, both in Tsinghua, the VR space and then the 3D projection. And so is what's happening.

**Ellen Larson**: Okay. I mean, I think it's really interesting that, you know, you're going from a space where, you know, you can enter into the library cave, you can be within the library cave. And then the projection, the newer work, you know, that's a space where you don't enter the library cave. Rather you're viewing from the outside.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah. Exactly. This inside. And. Outside and that instead of with the you outside and this so-called, this outside form is inferred. A a. Cost after. Negative space, it is a cost of the inside. So all this kind of, you know.

**Ellen Larson**: Oh I see, I see.

**Xie Xiaoze**: So it's this kind of, relationship. Yeah. Let me, you know, now that we are meeting at a studio, let me. Do one more thing for you.

**Ellen Larson**: So this. Yeah.

**Xie Xiaoze**: We see me?

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah.

**Xie Xiaoze**: It's it's this heavy enough, but light enough for me to hold it. This is the small. The small. Sculpture. And, it will be lit from from below the. Light that's embedded. Inside the pedestal. So this is a group of small size, sculptures. And I have. Quite a few you here in the. States, and they are the bigger ones because they are so heavy. They are now being shown in the. Shenzhen has some bigger. Ones, the smaller ones and then small ones like this. Beijing. Is going to do the same. In Shanghai, has the big ones already. They have four big ones because they said more of a group show. So anyway, that's, that's the. Object. Here.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah. I think it's really interesting how you're kind of, experimenting with the position of the viewer as well, right? Where, you know, there is an experience if they're using a VR headset where, you know, they can enter within or, with the projection, you know, they're standing outside yet it seems like the, the projection that they're able to see, it is still, and an interior space that you see from the outside, if that makes sense. So it seems like you're kind of, exploring with different, different positions and different, you know, different subjectivities of the, of the viewers.

**Xie Xiaoze**: En.

**Ellen Larson**: Is do you think that so.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah.

**Ellen Larson**: I mean, it's interesting that you also talked about, you know, your background in architecture. Is that something, you know, that you're that you're always thinking about regardless of the medium? You know, that kind of spatial, presentation or, you know, that kind of like physical engagement that a viewer might have with, with your work.

**Xie Xiaoze**: You know, the architecture. Background, my interest, in, in the, you know, space and experience of space is always there when thinking about this whole project. So even though it's, the first works, sort of like ink designs, but they are really more about space, so they should that that it has always been, this throughout a project. And it is not. Always so in other works, in other projects, sometimes maybe media and influence. So my sense of the composition, there could be kind of architectonic. So those who. That is more the case with the paintings. But this, this particular work is with this library project. It starts it started out as sort of this unit, you know, this this, space that it is a recurring kind of theme, a recurring unit or a theater space in which all kind of dramas happen.

**Ellen Larson**: 

**Greg Panciera**: I was going to ask, I think I think you may have just basically answered it, but is there a central sort of idea that you, you kind of keep finding yourself back at, or an emotion or something that you keep coming back to, with all of these different works. Is there something that kind of brings them together in your mind?

**Xie Xiaoze**: You mean within. A project, right?

**Greg Panciera**: Yeah. Across all these different, you know, forms that this project has taken and, you know, in, in paper to begin with and then ultimately and, you know, VR, video and.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Right.

**Greg Panciera**: Is there a, a place you kind of keep on coming back to that you feel your, your self wanting to express through these works.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Well, at the beginning. It seems kind of sometimes it could be sort of, scattered and I, you know, there may be a little disconnection between the analysis of various materials and textures in after objects found in the cave, in the specific words, from Buddhist Sutras. So.  But then eventually, things start to connect. But even it toward, the end or not the end, like toward, like 2024 when I, was studying, various, mandalas if I were in the cave. Then it, Quite a sudden, I realized, you know, this this, mandalas are also models of those. They are not unlike those in the, paintings, the Sanjie Jiudi, three realms and nine levels. So these, about, you know, connections between them in, in a later I found is, is history at the MET collection from me dynasty that is called the, Buddhist. The cos-, cosmological mandala with Mount. Meru. So it's, it's literally a combination of mandala in this and elements from Sanjie Jiudi. So they all they all start to connect. So, and then this, of course, the different mandala is always, connected, to specific, sutras. They each, you know, it's one specific form, configuration is based on a specific sutra. So, and then are similarities between them in it, each one also evolves over time like a later it becomes a very elaborate, very come complex. Then I feel like it's a bit overwhelming. But at the end is sort. Of a sort of start to come together. Right? It's all about worldview or model. And so, so then this theme of the, models of the universe or models of the world, only came up at last. Is setup is something that everything is leading toward.  I wonder if that answers the question.

**Greg Panciera**: Yeah. No. Yeah.

**Ellen Larson**: You know, in in looking at the, in looking at your website. Right. You also mention that the, the project itself, you're describing it as reinventing the library cave at Dunhuang, I'm really interested in you know, how you're using the word reinventing, right? You've chosen the word reinventing over reconstructing. Restoring or reconnecting. I'm curious, what does the word reinventing mean to you within the context of this project?

**Xie Xiaoze**:  reinventing. Yes, yes. The constructing is more in the sense of, like, reconstructing in re-, Imagining. A more complete scene that, once, you know, from from history. Right. How how was it, how did it look like before 1907? before Aurel Stein showed up,  and took. Staff out and, and, we, we have a good idea. About how. It kind of. Look like, when Pelliot was in the, in 1908. So these are. Imagination and. Imagination. Of course. It incorporates a certain.  Degree of. Reinvention. But I would say if there was. Only that. I would call it more like reimagine, reimagining, reconstructing historical settings. Then the reinvention part, to use the word in a way that is sort of, living up to its weight, would be the later part, like really freely. Combine different mandalas and turn it from into your metric forms and, and come up with these. Interlocking structures in sort of this sort of, in that case, I start to feel like as. As setting myself free. Without conforming to a specific. Kind of Buddhist.  Diagram of theory. You know, it would be like, okay, based on did I come up with this? This is sort of what could be like if I were to make my own kind of world model. World. A unique model of the universe.  And then the, there's one version about analysis of various materials.  These two imagine various, paper and, silk and, linen, out of bricks, metal, wood. They all sort of sort of become, like, dissolved. And they settle into layers, like the formation of rocks. I mean, this. Practically. Of course. Not. Not possible. It's only, this is really inventing new sort of sort of. Thinking in new ways that. Sculptors, artists, you know, perhaps poets, thinking, work, as opposed to like, say, archeologists will be, will be, walked in. But, there. Was one drawing, the very first, section of my, the scroll called, haofan jingshi, you know, these vast volumes then, to. Imagine how they were stacked from the end wall and moved to the both sides and sort of started to. Move toward the center. Now, that. Is a very I think it does intimate kind of archeology, archeological reconstruction of what could have happened in history. So it was closer to us, to the more like. Scholar side.  Scholarly side. And, what I the end of spectrum is the more crazy kind of artistic side, if that's fair.

**Ellen Larson**: For sure.

**Greg Panciera**: If do you, do you, do you ever sort of struggle to, to, to figure out which side you, you want to be investing your efforts in or where the, where the line is between these?

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah, yeah, that's a good question in my excuse, because first of all, I have to admit that before I go into doing well in 2017, in, and even until now, I am still very. Ignorant about, Dunhuang xue, the scholarship surrounding, you know, Dunhuang. In that, my last. Excuse, something to fall back on is always that. Okay, okay. I'm not an historian. I'm not archeologist. I'm not qualified. I'm an artist. I can do whatever I want. The thing is, nothing is really wrong. Right? So falling back, but following my back on that, I feel liberated. I feel like I could be this, doing things, freely here. Tianma xingkong (天马行空), you know, and these ideas coming to mind, the other, the liberating, thought I, had for myself. Is that. Okay? This is not a finished work. It's work in progress. It is. These are notes, sketches, you know, that allow myself to to understand. Things and configure things. And the this process be very. Honest. There are mistakes you know, the in the beginning, calligraphy was very raw. And okay so what but there's the whole process is there. There are dates, you know, on the only scroll and then any. It's a very. Real kind of, documentation. So with these two things in mind, I feel like it's, then I can freely move. In between the two without being worry about, the, other. Because in the later it came up. This kind of, the freedom that I gave myself, I had to sort of think about and, iterate, when I gave talks and in often times in doing a talk, I would be making fun of myself, calling myself sort of a, amateur archeologist, scholar, a pseudo archeologist. Maybe we were a conversation where we'll hold and you quickly point out, okay, you are a contemporary artist. So I don't get into other, other things, but the idea is to. Base on us, to combine this, analytical thinking with creative thinking, imaginative thinking in a poetic kind of, wondering. But this is a is a new direction. Is for me is something that is interesting.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah. And I think sort of along those the similar lines, you know, thinking about your movement right in between, you know, being being an artist, a contemporary artist, an archeologist, or in your words, a pseudo archeologist. Right. I'm also interested in, in, you know, your own experiences. Right? You've you've spent time at Dunhuang where these library, where the library cave is physically located. Right. And then you know, of course, you've also traveled to the British Library where many of these sutras, they're now kept right after their removal, as you mentioned, beginning in 1907. And so I'm really curious, you know, in that that movement between Dunhuang and the British Library, I'm curious, what was that experience like to see those sutras for the first time? and also, I'm wondering how, you know, you kind of negotiate that location, right? In between being, you know, at Dunhuang, where the sutras once were, and then the British Library, where the sutras are now located. And I'm wondering how you think about that kind of disbursement, that, you know, not only is a physical kind of disbursement, but then I also, you know, wonder if you know how you think about, you know, your own witness to that disbursement. In between both of these places.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Right. It's, it's a, I mean, nowadays practically, practically, I rely on, books and online sources like, say, it would be, at the beginning I use these, those, set-up books a lot.法藏敦煌文献，英藏敦煌文献 (French Preserved Dunhuang Literature, British Preserved Dunhuang Literature). so on and so forth. And, and then more. Recently, I have learned to, take advantage of the international Dunhuang project to assess for, high resolution images in, between our information dates. Of this from the, online sources. I also, you know, look up articles and, you know, books. There are a few articles. They're very important for me, including the one the photo study of the, the star chart. So these are the practical. Point of view. But equally. Practical or more inspirational would be my experience at the Mogao Grottoes. When I was in residency at that time, I leave, I stay in the, Macao Shanzhuang (Mogao Village). Macao. How do you translate, the village hotel and it goes, right. At the Mogao Grottoes and, you know, from the. Window of my hotel room, I was able to see these rows of caves in the northern section where the monks, once believed, then, to the left side. You know, that would be, the section where the library cave, is located. And so it's morning. I would, you know, sometimes I, I walk out of the gate up to, the hotel and turn right. I would be bypassing past, I'll be passing by the, Daoshi Ta (道士塔), the pagoda, Wang Yuanlu (王圆箓), where he was buried.  And then I will walk, another 100m or so. Then I would enter into, you know, the area, with the, many photos, including the library cave. So, and then, of course, the Academy where my temporary studio was, is very close by within walking distance. So this to be there and to be there along. A lot of times, was very special experience, this kind of, not isolation, but how do you call that. You know, I can say, relative kind of isolation from the rest of the world and live in, I think the different. Kind of. Time zone like this, like, you know, about at least about 100 years ago in 1907, 1908, a bit of time, seem. Very recent. It seems like yesterday. Okay. He's just took those away. He was just in there sorting through the entities scrolls. Wang Yuanlu was still around. So there was a very, very special feeling. And I think that's the kind of. Experience of the science experience of, locations. It was very important for, a kind of poetic, expression that was after. Then, i kind of then carried. That, back to California, you know, and I was working and I work in my studio here, and I have used those books. I look at those, browse through the photographs I took there. But the experience that kind of, you know, the feeling I got was, something irreplaceable. As to the British. Library, I have not. I have, have to admit it. I have seen relatively few of those scrolls. I may have seen some things randomly. I saw this one, northern dynasty. A scroll in person in the storage area of the Dunhuang Academy. One of the few things, that, in the collection of of, the Academy that actually from the cave, but this was,大般涅槃经(Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra), 如来性品 as the northern dynasty script. It has this clerical style, so. So, anyway, then I saw this in 1916. When I was with the group, but the group. Didn't go. To the stories and see that I did that. After they left, I stayed one more day and then I managed to see it. So my personal connection and and it was a stick in my head and later is this callig-, style of calligraphy, was used a lot in my, in my school, in my, ink signs and, also used in the sculptures. The British Library. I had not seen. Much when I was there. I might have seen random pieces. But this time, when I travel in later this month, that will be the time I get to see more.

**Ellen Larson**: Oh. That's great.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah, yeah. It's super. Exciting.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah. And so I really does, you know, you you mentioned that, you know, this project, there's there's like time is a really important aspect of the project, you know, like for you to spend time in Dunhuang and then go back to your studio in California, you know, to travel a little bit. A lot of time is, is really required for you to, for you to pursue it. And, you know, the fact that you haven't been able to see a lot of objects in the British Library yet, but will I think that that's also really interesting and also interesting aspect of this project. And, you know, the time that that it requires.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Is actually. Yeah. Oh, about time. And, again, also space and locations, sites.

**Ellen Larson**: Exactly.

**Xie Xiaoze**: This time has been the, the, the single one, primary element time will be it.

**Ellen Larson**: Well, that's really interesting.

**Xie Xiaoze**: We are not using this conversation as formal content for the platform. Right? I, I was thinking this was more just like, touching base.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah. I think that we were sort of thinking of, of this conversation as an opportunity for us to ask you questions about the the project. We wanted to record it so that maybe if there were pieces, we could use those pieces on our website, maybe ways in which you're talking about the project.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Okay. I understand.

**Ellen Larson**: So we also wanted to, create a transcript, but, we definitely will share everything with you before we publish anything. And we also don't really see this, as, you know, being published in its entirety from beginning to the end, because this it's kind of, you know, a way for us to just, you know, be, you know, you've never met Greg before. So, for us to kind of be introduced first, if that's okay.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Greg is completely fine. And in fact, this is a good idea. And I would be. Interested to see, like, like, a record what I have to say. I know that there's a lot of it is not super like, say, prepared or, polished. But they may be phrases. They may be sentences that, they actually did not come up during my previous discussion of the project. That could be actually a nice kind of addition, to what I have to say. And although although some of these, most of these are very spontaneous, as you recognize. Right. But they are some I hope they have some points. They're still kind of, you know, good to good and useful for, for the future when you try to come up with some content. I've completely open.

**Ellen Larson & Greg Panciera**: Great. Yeah. No, there's been this has been fascinating.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Thank you. So, to put, specifically on the online, is it like a. Online platform or kind of publication? Did you introduce your project in a more in more specific terms?

**Greg Panciera**: So I think, I think the idea so we have, a project called the Dispersed Chinese Art Digitization Project, and that's the sort of, or DCADP for short. And that's the the sort of main project that I'm involved in. And, essentially it involves, 3D scanning sites in China and then, that are missing, artifacts and then going in 3D, scanning those objects in museums around the world and producing digital reconstructions of these spaces. But, beyond that, so that, that, that has, you know, obviously scholarly application and, and, and would be interesting potentially to the general public. But, we're also interested in trying to think about, what else, what else can come of this? You know, what new approaches, can come out of working or starting with, say a 3D, restore restoration, of an ancient site. And, you know, this obviously aligns precisely, you know, with the direction that you've been spending years now exploring. And how can we think about these things in new ways and what new sorts of ideas or approaches can come out of it? And so that's sort of more where this new section of the website, that someone mentioned, sort of tentatively might be called Contemporary Parallels does. And so at the moment, it's just a section of the website that would present some of these other sort of ideas that are, you know, parallel or related to the, sort of scholarly part of the project. So we were thinking, you know, conversations with artists such as yourselves or perhaps other people that are working on sort of similar kinds of projects, maybe we would, eventually feature some, some actual works on that part of the site videos, for instance. Things of that nature.

**Ellen Larson**: Greg, would you be willing to maybe show Professor Scheer, our 3D, reconstruction that's on the website or.

**Greg Panciera**: Here, I'll just show you,

**Xie Xiaoze**: So this is a project of the East Asian. Studies Center, right?

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah, the center for the of East Asia. So the the center that Professor Wu founded in 2003.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Oh, okay. Okay.

**Greg Panciera**: So, so this is one of the projects, based on the two, temple in Beijing. It's, this is an image of the, one foot pavilion as it is today. And the this this large, empty sort of part of the ceiling originally featured, like an elaborate wooden carved, sculpture. That is in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. It's been up here. So we have, a 3D reconstruction of this space, essentially looks like this. And we're still kind of, I think, trying to think through different ways, you know, to share this, but fundamentally, I think this, this is kind of creating a new work in one sense and the sense that that, you know, this isn't the historic space, the new way of experiencing maybe the way this space might have been or might have felt to somebody visiting it. Mistakes to the, 15th and 16th century Ming dynasty, but as I said, kind of, you know, I think also of interest here is, is, you know, where where else can people go with this? What are what are some new ideas that could come out of this sort of thing?

**Xie Xiaoze**: Right. This looks that looks fascinating. They can navigate, you know, this, certainly this would be.

**Greg Panciera**: I noticed and I noticed in some of your drawings, but the turn on project, I think it was some of the early drawings you had produced. One of the first versions was your sort of imagination of what it probably looked like. You know, when it was in, in the early 20th century. So in a sense, I was thinking, oh, you know, you're, you're sort of starting from a similar place. Maybe this, you know, this is a fancy, fancy version of it, but, you know, you're starting from what it might have looked like and then branching from there with all of your ideas.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah. Yeah.

**Greg Panciera**: That sound.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah. That looks great. It looks great. I think it would be useful information about it. Particularly is appropriate for online kind of platform. And now it's become technology. Allow it to be more interactive and, and spatial. So it's great. Yeah. Yeah. Thinking in that direction, maybe some of my, versions, could be turned into sort of a 3D model, and you can navigate like you the this, what you has showed me.

**Ellen Larson**: Exactly. Yeah. And I think, you know, we're in this place, as Greg just mentioned, where we're thinking about what we can do with these, with these models, with these materials. But it also kind of it also kind of makes me think of a question for you. You know, you are also using similar technologies. You know, you've used VR, you're also working on projection, as part of your own practice and, and research, related to the Dunhuang project. And so I guess I'm, I'm also curious what what made you choose these kinds of, of technologies? Rather than, you know, two dimensional or, like a three dimensional sculpture object. What was it about? You know, the VR or the kind of multimedia, interactive, digital tools that that made you, that that made you what made you choose those, those digital, tools?

**Xie Xiaoze**: Okay. Yeah. The great question is, I mean, from the beginning, even making those. Two dimensional drawings, I was always thinking about three dimensional space and and thinking about making casts and realizing in loose real space. And then the, for a long time, I'd been thinking about this, realizing this simple version of the rain of words, you know, with, 3D projection and, and, like, little mockups came up, maybe, well, what's it like, 18 or 19? very early, but never got to be realized, and they weren't the easiest. So then there is the work. When an opportunity came up and, and then it would be, more people, I can collaborate with in this how this 3D projection came about. It's up to being invited to the Dunhuang Contemporary Art museum showing in Shanghai. They are collaborative, are this team with two people and, the VR thing was more of, I wasn't thinking about the VR, at the beginning, but it was Pingshan Art show, Pingshan Museum. Show, I was planning to do this 3D projection and then because of, the limit of funds, they couldn't do it. And it was the cut of the, budget. Well, that my exhibition budget was cut to almost zero. And then later they had to find another source and raise some money and came up with a budget which is half the size of what it was originally planned for. And then so they came up this idea of using an existing VR project and let my work become part of that bigger project so that we can utilize some of the funds that was already allocated for the project and then use it in the exhibition. That's how that happened. And I ended up having meetings with this VR team, a few times. And learn learn about it. I had, some ideas that were not very suitable for, for the, and they were pointed out, I said, oh, I didn't know that that's possible. And it's not in this, this learning process. And now I no longer feel any I mean, for year. I do feel pressure sometimes that. Timidity at times with technical, technological elements, but I feel way more comfortable to talk to people. And this is what I want. And and. Why couldn't you not. Do this? You know. How about you try that and then you. Things keep moving along. It was good. I had a. Good experience working with this new media.

**Ellen Larson**: That's great. So even though, you know the the VR component, you know, there was definitely a practical reason why you chose VR or why VR was chosen for you. Maybe, at the same time, were there aspects of that presentation that really surprised you or that you realized, oh, I really I really like, you know, the, the capability of VR in, you know, this way or that way where there were there things that kind of, are you will take in as you continue to work on future projects?

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah, yeah. I hadn't thought that super far, but. I'm certain it sort of opens up something different. And this, this VR. Experience of, like, closing your eyes and, well, not closing your eyes, but but covering it up so that you are sort of insulated from your immediate physical world into another space. That's very interesting. That's quite, fascinating. Talk. And, that also, parallels the, the imagined experience of meditation. And, you know, when you, you, you, see, enter another mental state.

**Ellen Larson**: That's really interesting.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Different. Well, this, this is something. An idea occurred to me. I wonder if that maybe any, like, the possibility of looking into, venues for the, University of Chicago. Like, physical presentation. I'm certainly interested because, the university has such a rich history, of, so in contemporary Chinese art for one thing, and also as important side of these Asian studies, on the other, I wonder there might be a way for, for the center to become sort of like, you know, to facilitate, possible, physical. Show.  On campus.

**Ellen Larson**: I mean, I think that that's, that's ultimately our goal is, you know, is it's to be able to, you know, create these kinds of physical presentations. You know, we're we're still in a place in the project where we are figuring out how to take the, you know, these objects from, the digital into a real physical space. But, you know, that's I think that that's a, that's a goal that, that I have. And, you know, we're talking about how we can, you know, execute these, these, these presentations in, in a real physical space. We also think that, you know, there's so, again, you know, coming back to, you know, how when, when we were first envisioning this particular part of, of our project, you know, thinking about contemporary connections to, objects, from the past, you know, that you're you were the first person to come to my mind because, you know, the dream is, is to, certainly be able to collaborate on, on some kind of, of physical presentation.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Great. Sounds great. I certainly will be very excited to do that. And is this, of course, applicable to, up to, habit, being artists, you know, to doing this physical thing. So although, you know, when there is no possible online platform and so, talks and, and things that are more so less physical also help to, to, you know, useful for communication and, spreading the word.

**Ellen Larson**: Exactly. Yeah, yeah. And you, you know, you you, are currently collaborating with Professor Wu Hung, and he, he curated your most recent exhibition in Shenzhen. So, you know, the, the your relationship with the center or, you know, is, is an established one already.

**Xie Xiaoze**: That's great. That's great to know you are working there. You have been to my studio. They said, yeah, they have direct you experience of those scrolls before they were shipped away. Right. Us yeah.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah, yeah. Greg, just, to give you a little bit of context before Professor Xie installed the exhibition in Shenzhen. I got to see all of the the two dimensional scrolls. But I also, I also know that, you know, Greg would be very interested in the work as well. Greg has, you know, background and interest, in Buddhist studies as well. So, you know, that kind of I think.

**Xie Xiaoze**: That. That's nice to hear. Yeah. Wonderful.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah. I hope you don't mind me calling you out. Greg. 

**Xie Xiaoze**: Excuse me to.

**Ellen Larson**: But, I mean, I, I'm mindful of time. We've we've been chatting for a while, and maybe for now, we could we could leave it. We could leave it here. But I also hope that we can kind of continue the conversation, you know, if we have other questions or, you know, if there are other, other, you know, things that that might be useful for us to talk about as a group, maybe we could, meet again. But but do you have any. I don't mean to, you know, cut you off in any way. Do you have any, additional questions or, or anything else that you wanted to bring up?

**Greg Panciera**: No, this was this was fantastic. I think, it might be interesting to, to, you know, consider whether, any of your works might be, you know, good to actually show on a website or something that would be of interest, or that would be suitable for that. Or at the very least, you know, that we could include some images of some of the works that, you know, you referenced here on the website.

**Xie Xiaoze**: That's, that's, fairly easy to do. I have, high resolution. Images of most, most works. And I don't I. Don't think of any works that, I would not show online, I. It's, so I would be happy to be happy. To provide my whatever I have at hand, texts, images, sometimes, video clips.

**Ellen Larson**: Oh, wonderful. Great. Well, thank you so much, Professor Xie, for your time. I, you know, I go, Greg, this is a really exciting way for us to kind of, jump into this project. And we look forward to continuing the conversation with you soon.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Okay. Thank you so much. And, yeah, thank. You for, excuse me. You know.

**Ellen Larson**: No problem, no problem.

**Greg Panciera**: No worries at all. No worries at all.

**Ellen Larson**: And safe travels.

**Xie Xiaoze**: We thank you. Yeah, well, I'll. I'll I'll share my experience.

**Ellen Larson**: Yeah. Please do.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah. I'm in London in the new show. Yeah. Wu Hung is also. Curating the news.

**Ellen Larson**: So I wondered.

**Xie Xiaoze**: And. Then also the, chair to the symposium. So. Great. Yeah. So, I would, we pulled from the upcoming events.

**Ellen Larson**: Super. Well, thank you so much. Have a wonderful afternoon. And and we'll be in touch soon.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Okay. Great. Thank you both. Of course. Thank you. Jeff, from the screen.

**Ellen Larson**: Bye bye.

**Xie Xiaoze**: Yeah.
